# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Delete the `/workflows` folder

## Action Required

You have a duplicate GitHub Actions workflow file in `/workflows/deploy.yml`. 

**GitHub Actions only reads workflows from `.github/workflows/` directory.**

### What to do:

1. **Delete the entire `/workflows` folder:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf workflows/
   ```

2. **The correct workflow file is already in place:**
   - ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (this is the one GitHub uses)
   - ❌ `workflows/deploy.yml` (delete this one)

3. **After deletion, commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove duplicate workflow file"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Why this matters

- GitHub only recognizes workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Having duplicate files can cause confusion
- The deployment will work correctly once the duplicate is removed

## Current Status

✅ **Correct file:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - configured for https://nategoss.github.io/nate-goss-portfolio  
❌ **Duplicate file:** `workflows/deploy.yml` - should be deleted

Your portfolio will deploy correctly to **https://nategoss.github.io/nate-goss-portfolio** once you remove the duplicate workflow folder.
