### Monitor Deployment
1. [ ] Go to **Actions** tab
2. [ ] Watch "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. [ ] Ensure it completes successfully (green checkmark)
4. [ ] Check deployment time (usually 2-5 minutes)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### URLs to Test
- [ ] Homepage: `https://nategoss.github.io/nate-portfolio/`
- [ ] Projects: `https://nategoss.github.io/nate-portfolio/projects`
- [ ] Case Study: `https://nategoss.github.io/nate-portfolio/case-study/saas-dashboard`

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails
1. [ ] Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. [ ] Verify build works locally: `npm run build`
3. [ ] Check permissions in repository settings
4. [ ] Ensure workflow file is correct

### If Site Shows 404
1. [ ] Verify GitHub Pages source is "GitHub Actions"
2. [ ] Check if deployment workflow completed
3. [ ] Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
4. [ ] Check repository name is exactly `nate-portfolio`

### If Routes Don't Work
1. [ ] Verify SPA routing scripts in index.html and 404.html
2. [ ] Check that base path in vite.config.ts is correct
3. [ ] Test direct URL access after waiting a few minutes

### If Styles Are Missing
1. [ ] Check browser console for 404 errors on CSS/JS files
2. [ ] Verify base path configuration
3. [ ] Clear browser cache and try again
